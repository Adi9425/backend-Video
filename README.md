Summary of this project
This project is a complex backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt, and many more. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have. We are building a complete video hosting website similar to youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

Project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more. We have spent a lot of time in building this project and we are sure that you will learn a lot from this project.
This project involves developing a robust backend system for a video hosting website, similar to YouTube, using modern web development practices and technologies. The backend will support core features such as user authentication, video uploads, and user interactions while maintaining secure and scalable code.  

Technologies and Tools Used  
- Node.js: Backend runtime environment.  
- Express.js: Framework for building APIs.  
- MongoDB & Mongoose: Database and ORM for data management.  
- JWT: Secure user authentication and session management.  
- Bcrypt: Password hashing for enhanced security.  

Key Features  
1. Authentication:  
   - User registration and login functionality using secure practices (JWT, bcrypt).  
   - Implementation of access tokens and refresh tokens for session management.  

2. Video Hosting Features:  
   - Upload, delete, and update videos.  
   - View and interact with video content (like, dislike).  
   - Commenting and replying functionality.  

3. User Interaction:  
   - Subscribe and unsubscribe to channels.  
   - Like, dislike, and reply to comments.  

4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):  
   - Permissions based on user roles.  
   - Only video owners can delete or update their videos.  
   - Admin users manage content, while regular users have read-only permissions for sensitive actions.  

5. Standard Practices:  
   - Follows modern backend best practices.  
   - Secure handling of sensitive data with bcrypt and JWT.  

Key Points:  
- Implementing secure authentication and authorization workflows.  
- Structuring a complex backend system with scalability in mind.  
- Managing relational and hierarchical data with MongoDB.  
- Employing secure coding practices for sensitive user data.  
- Building APIs to support dynamic features and user interactions.
